This is a repo containing my nvim configurations. 

Usage:
1. Download Repo
2. Go to config/init.lua, comment out gruvbox, and save
3. Reopen neovim and type in ':PackerInstall' This will install gruvbox.
4. Go back to where you commented out gruvbox and uncomment it
5. Install go-pls binaries with :GoInstallBinaries
6. Install python language server with ```npm i -g pyright```
7. Install ripgrep (It is necessary for fuzzy grep aka the telescope plugin)
